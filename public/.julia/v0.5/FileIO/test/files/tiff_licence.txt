Images are in .tiff format, no compression.

Included below, are files containing semantic rating data from
psychological experiments using the images. I send it because I
believe it is important to realize that expression are never pure
expressions of one emotion, but always admixtures of different
emotions. The expression labels on the images just represent the
predominant expression in that image - the expression that the subject
was asked to pose.
